# code_samples
Here are some samples of projects I have been working on during the past year at Oulu University of Applied Sciences (Oamk). 

"matopeli_v1_11" is a snake-game written for a group project during the second period of my first year at Oamk. It was written for arduino using an 8x8 led matrix-display, 
and some push-buttons on a breadboard. In the .ino file are only the parts that I wrote for the program (interfacing with the MAX7219 LED DRIVER, 
coding the input buttons, game logic etc.) with plenty of comments (in finnish) for the program. The program was written in arduino C++ using arduinoIDE.

"bankautomat_crud" is a utility program I wrote for a group project during the last period of my first year at Oamk. The program is a GUI-application for managing the database 
used to save data for bank users, accounts, credit and debit cards etc. The program was written in Qt C++ using Qt Creator 4.3.1 Community edition.

"Coder's sociability app"
https://github.com/Sompelo/koodarin_sosiaalisuusappi
Coder's sociability app is a mobile application written in React Native. It attempts to gamify basic physical and social activities that a lone, reclusive coder might find challenging. It uses Google's Firebase database for user authentication and Firestore database for additional user data. The databases are currently inactive.

"Student database web application"
https://github.com/Sompelo/javan_lopputyo_samuli_salmi_tvt21kmo
This project is a web application for accessing a student data database. The backend is a Java SpringBoot-server and the frontend is written in vanilla JavaScript. With this app you can add courses and students into the database, search for them as well as modify and delete them.

Group Projects I've been a part of: 

"Leip√§jono-Application"
https://github.com/Ryhma-9/Web-ohjelmoinnin_sovellusprojekti
A Foodora/Wolt style application for ordering food from a restaurant using a web application. Created for a web appliction course as a group of 4. Frontend is written in JacaScript using React framework and the backend is written in Java. I worked building the backend datastructures and database connections as well as some frontend routing and web page components (shopping cart and payment screens for example). 

"GeoSnapper Social Media Application"
https://github.com/Mobiilisovellusprojekti-TVT21KMO-R10/GeoSnapper_Project
A Social media app build for a mobile application course. Made for a Mobile application course in a group of 3. An application written in Kotlin for a geography-based social media application. The app allows users to leave anonymous messages in the application attached to a physical geological location (Think of it as a Dark Souls-style messaging system in real world). These messages can then be viewed by other users near to the geological coordinates of the message. Messages can also be up- or down-voted freely by other users, affecting their visibility and duration. For a small fee, a message can be cheered up for additional visibility for a certain amount of time. My responsibilities were building the database (Firestore) and its connections, some frontend components such as the profile view and with debugging.
