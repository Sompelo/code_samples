# code_samples
Here are some samples of projects I have been working on during the past year at Oulu University of Applied Sciences (Oamk). 

"matopeli_v1_11" is a snake-game written for a group project during the second period of my first year at Oamk. It was written for arduino using an 8x8 led matrix-display, 
and some push-buttons on a breadboard. In the .ino file are only the parts that I wrote for the program (interfacing with the MAX7219 LED DRIVER, 
coding the input buttons, game logic etc.) with plenty of comments (in finnish) for the program. The program was written in arduino C++ using arduinoIDE.

"bankautomat_crud" is a utility program I wrote for a group project during the last period of my first year at Oamk. The program is a GUI-application for managing the database 
used to save data for bank users, accounts, credit and debit cards etc. The program was written in Qt C++ using Qt Creator 4.3.1 Community edition.

"Coder's sociability app"
https://github.com/Sompelo/koodarin_sosiaalisuusappi
Coder's sociability app is a mobile application written in React Native. It attempts to gamify basic physical and social activities that a lone, reclusive coder might find challenging. It uses Google's Firebase database for user authentication and Firestore database for additional user data. The databases are currently inactive.
